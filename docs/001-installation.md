# Installation

### Install Symfony CLI
Symfony CLI is very handy tool but it's optional. Symfony application can create using composer. But I personally strongly suggest to use symfony CLI as it provides all the tools you need to develop and run your Symfony application locally.

#### In Linux
```bash
wget https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer -O - | bash
```

#### In Mac
```
curl -sS https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer | bash
```

#### In windows
Download and install symfony CLI setup.exe file.
```
https://get.symfony.com/cli/setup.exe
```
